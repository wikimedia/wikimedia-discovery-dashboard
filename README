==Running in labs

Go to Special:NovaInstance on wikitech and start a new instance. The
The small instance with 2GB of memory is sufficient. Leave the image
type at the default of 'debian-8.1-jessie' and click go. Wait for
the instance to start, then login via ssh.

First we need to clone the repository:
$ sudo git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/wikimedia/discovery/dashboard /srv/dashboards

Then we need to provision everything:
$ sudo bash /srv/dashboards/setup.sh

shiny-server should now be running on port 3838. To make this
available to the world visit Special:NovaProxy in wikitech. Point a
subdomain at the instance and make sure to port 3838 as the instance
port.

==Running on your machine

Should be a simple `vagrant up`.

==Updating

From inside the instance (ssh for labs, vagrant ssh for vagrant):

$ cd /srv/dashboards
$ sudo git pull --ff-only
$ sudo git submodule update --init --recursive
$ sudo service shiny-server restart
